					<p class="section-info">
						Mary G. Harris Jones (1837 (baptized) – November 30, 1930), known as
						Mother Jones from 1897 onwards, was an Irish-born American
						schoolteacher and dressmaker who became a prominent union organizer,
						community organizer, and activist. She helped coordinate major
						strikes and co-founded the Industrial Workers of the World. In 1902,
						she was called "the most dangerous woman in America" for her success
						in organizing mine workers and their families against the mine
						owners. In 1903, to protest the lax enforcement of the child labor
						laws in the Pennsylvania mines and silk mills, she organized a
						children's march from Philadelphia to the home of President Theodore
						Roosevelt in New York.

					<h2 class="section-headline">Early Life</h2>
					<p class="section-info">
						Mary G. Harris was born on the north side of Cork, the daughter of
						Roman Catholic tenant farmers Richard and Ellen Harris. Her exact
						date of birth is uncertain; she was baptized on August 1, 1837.
						Harris and her family were victims of the Great Famine, as were many
						other Irish families. The famine drove more than a million families,
						including the Harrises, to immigrate to North America when Harris
						was 10.

					<h2 class="section-headline">"March of the Mill Children"</h2>
					<p class="section-info">
						In 1901, workers in Pennsylvania's silk mills went on strike. Many
						of them were young women demanding to be paid adult wages.[19] The
						1900 census had revealed that one sixth of American children under
						the age of sixteen were employed. John Mitchell, the president of
						the UMWA (United Mine Workers Association), brought Mother Jones to
						north-east Pennsylvania in the months of February and September to
						encourage unity among striking workers. To do so, she encouraged the
						wives of the workers to organize into a group that would wield
						brooms, beat on tin pans, and shout "join the union!"
					</p>
					<p class="section-info">
						In 1903, Jones organized children who were working in mills and
						mines to participate in her famous "March of the Mill Children" from
						Kensington, Philadelphia, to the summer house (and Summer White
						House) of President Theodore Roosevelt on Long Island (in Oyster
						Bay, New York). They had banners demanding "We want to go to school
						and not the mines!" and held rallies each night in a new town on the
						way with music, skits, and speeches drawing thousands of citizens.
					</p>
					<p class="section-info">
						As Mother Jones noted, many of the children at union headquarters
						were missing fingers and had other disabilities, and she attempted
						to get newspaper publicity for the bad conditions experienced by
						children working in Pennsylvania. However, the mill owners held
						stock in most newspapers. When the newspapermen informed her that
						they could not publish the facts about child labor because of this,
						she remarked "Well, I've got stock in these little children and I'll
						arrange a little publicity." Permission to see President Roosevelt
						was denied by his secretary, and it was suggested that Jones address
						a letter to the president requesting a visit with him. Even though
						Mother Jones wrote a letter asking for a meeting, she never received
						an answer. Though the president refused to meet with the marchers,
						the incident brought the issue of child labor to the forefront of
						the public agenda. The 2003 non-fiction book Kids on Strike!
						described Jones's Children's Crusade in detail.

					<h2 class="section-headline">Activism and Criminal Charges</h2>
					<p class="section-info">
						During the Paint Creek–Cabin Creek strike of 1912 in West Virginia,
						Mary Jones arrived in June 1912, speaking and organizing despite a
						shooting war between United Mine Workers members and the private
						army of the mine owners. Martial law in the area was declared and
						rescinded twice before Jones was arrested on February 13, 1913, and
						brought before a military court. Accused of conspiring to commit
						murder among other charges, she refused to recognize the legitimacy
						of her court-martial. She was sentenced to twenty years in the state
						penitentiary. During house arrest at Mrs. Carney's Boarding House,
						she acquired a dangerous case of pneumonia.
					</p>
					<p class="section-info">
						She was released after 85 days of confinement and several months
						later, helped organize coal miners in Colorado in the 1913–14 United
						Mine Workers of America strike against the Rockefeller-owned
						Colorado Fuel and Iron company, in what is known as the Colorado
						Coalfield War. Once again she was arrested, serving time in prison
						and inside the San Rafael Hospital, and was escorted from the state
						in the months prior to the Ludlow Massacre.

							Jones' words are still invoked by union supporters more than a
							century later: "Pray for the dead and fight like hell for the
							living." Already known as "the miners' angel" when she was
							denounced on the floor of the United States Senate as the
							"grandmother of all agitators", she replied, "I hope to live long
							enough to be the great-grandmother of all agitators."

							During the bitter 1989–90 Pittston Coal strike in Virginia, West
							Virginia and Kentucky, the wives and daughters of striking coal
							miners, inspired by the still-surviving tales of Jones's legendary
							work among an earlier generation of the region's coal miners,
							dubbed themselves the "Daughters of Mother Jones". They played a
							crucial role on the picket lines and in presenting the miners'
							case to the press and public.
